**Last Updated:** December 30, 2025

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how **Dreamweaver Stories** ("we", "us", or "our") handles your data.

## 1. No Personal Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or share any personal information (such as your name, email address, phone number, or location) on our servers. We do not require you to create an account to use the app.

## 2. Local Data Storage
All data generated within the app is stored locally on your device:
* **Story Credits:** Your credit balance is stored securely in your device's Keychain.
* **Story History:** The stories and illustrations you create are saved in your device's local storage.
* **Data Loss:** Because data is stored locally, deleting the app may result in the permanent loss of your generated stories and credit balance. We do not maintain a cloud backup of your data.

## 3. Third-Party Services
We use trusted third-party services to provide the app's core functionality. By using the app, you acknowledge that data may be processed by these providers:

* **OpenAI API:** We send the text inputs (Name, Theme, Moral) you provide to OpenAI to generate the story text and illustrations. OpenAI does not use this data to train their models.
* **Apple Services:** All financial transactions (In-App Purchases) are handled directly by Apple's App Store. We do not have access to your credit card information or billing details.

## 4. Children’s Privacy
Our app is designed for families and children. We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under the age of 13.
